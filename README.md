🧠 How It Works
The app uses JavaScript’s Date object to fetch the current time and updates the DOM every second using setInterval. This ensures the time display remains accurate and fluid.

📈 Future Enhancements
Add dark/light mode toggle

Include timezone selection

Display date alongside time

Add alarm or stopwatch functionality
